## IoT BLE App


Arduino Curie BLE (Arduino 101 Board) example for the
Arduino Sensor Kit https://store.arduino.cc/usa/sensor-kit-base

- This example code is in the public domain and is based on arduino.cc
- The Arduino_SensorKit.h library is used to communicate with the sensors and the CurieBLE.h library is used to communicate with the "IoT BLE App" application created in App Inventor
 
> Note: This sketch was created for the BLE stack of the Arduino 101 board, if you use another, you will have to make the necessary changes.
